            <p> <font size= "2"> We are so very excited to begin the journey of changing lives with our incoming class of students.  Monday, September 22 is the first day in an arduous 12 week adventure that will end with our hair styling warriors ready to take on whatever hair challenge awaits them.  I want to welcome all of the new students and congratulate them on taking the first step towards realizing their dreams!
            We had a blast meeting new students at our open house on Wednesday while enjoying some delicious macarons.  I really enjoyed hearing everyone's back story and what brought them to The Iron Snips. On behalf of the entire Iron Snips team here in Houston, I can say I truly can not wait to see what these rock stars are going to be able to accomplish and beautify.</font></p>
